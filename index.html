            <h2>Projects and experience</h2>

            <h3>University of Canterbury</h3>
            <p>
                At university I was involved in both the Computing Society (COMPSOC), and the Women in Technology society
                (now WiTSoc). I tutotored the two 1st year CompSci courses, and 2nd year Algorithms. My Honours thesis was <a href="https://csse.canterbury.ac.nz/research/reports/HonsReps/abstracts/1511_abs.html" target="_blank">Therapy Personalisation in Software for People

                    With Aphasia</a> in conjunction with the <a
                    href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/research/about-uc-research/research-groups-and-centres/intellihealth-systems-research-lab" target="_blank">IntelliHealth
                    Research Group</a>. These experiences lead to passions I carry with me: fostering communities, sharing knowledge, explaining and distilling concepts, and creating things to better the world.

            </div>
            <h3>Code First Girls</h3>
            <p>
                I was a volunteer instructor for <a href="http://codefirstgirls.com">Code First Girls</a> via my employer, Google UK, who hosted the course at their Kings Cross Offices. 
                Code First Girls is a provider of free coding courses for women and non-binary people, and the beginner course taught how to create your own website using HTML, CSS, Javascript using GitHub. 
                It was especially rewarding to see the students helping each other, overcoming bugs and obstacles, and being able to present their work to everyone at the end of the course.

            </p>

            <h3>Google Assistant (Actions On Google)</h3>
            <p>As a Technical Solutions Consultant, one of the products I worked on was Google Assistant, specifically the third-party apps - <i>Actions on Google (AoG)</i>. 
                Using the APIs, Dialogflow and <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/console" target="_blank">Google's dashboard</a>, 
                people could create and launch applications for the Google Assistant. </p>
                
                <p>For Google I/O 2018 I designed the architecture and helped build the <i>Google Pay Bakery</i> app to demonstrate the new transactions functionality. Attendees could go to the Assistant Sandbox tent, 
                    and use the app to pick a cookie design, and submit the order with a chosen name/alias.
